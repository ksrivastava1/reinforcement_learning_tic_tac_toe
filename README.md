# Learning Tic Tac Toe with Reinforcement Learning

This repository implements a method of using reinforcement learning to learn the game of Tic Tac Toe. The method is an implementation of tabular reinforcement learning methods from (Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning)[https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/10-703/textbook/BartoSutton.pdf]. 

This code was designed to run on python 3.* with numpy 1.19.*. For faster results, you can use numba version 0.53.*. This has already been implemented and only needs to be uncommented in train.py and utils.py.
